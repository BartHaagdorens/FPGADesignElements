<h1>A Priority Arbiter</h1>
<p>Returns a one-hot bitmask of the least-significant bit set in a word, where
 bit 0 can be viewed as having highest priority. </p>
<p>The requestors must raise and hold a <code>requests</code> bit and wait until the
 corresponding <code>grant</code> bit rises to begin their transaction. At any point,
 the highest priority request is granted.  The grant remains for as long as
 the request is held without interruption, <em>or until a higher priority
 request appears</em>. Requesters can hold or drop their requests as desired, as
 this is a combinational circuit.</p>
<p>This Priority Arbiter is the building block of more complex arbiters: By
 masking other requests with a mask derived from the grants, we can alter
 the priority scheme as desired, and guarantee the current grant cannot be
 interrupted by another request. </p>
<p>A common use-case for an arbiter is to drive a <a href="./Multiplexer_One_Hot.html">one-hot
 multiplexer</a> to select one of multiple senders
 requesting for one receiver, or one of multiple receivers requesting from
 one sender.</p>
<p>Note that if a higher-priority request happens too frequently, even if
 brief, it will starve lower priority requests. To distribute the grants
 fairly, you need a <a href="./Arbiter_Round_Robin.html">Round-Robin Arbiter</a>.</p>
