<h1>References and Reading List</h1>

<p>Here are the sources I've used while writing this book, organized by topic.

<li> <a name="Warren2013"></a><a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916060535/http://hackersdelight.org/">Hacker's
Delight</a>, 2nd ed., 2013, Henry S. Warren, Jr. This book covers algorithms
related to bit manipulation, arithmetic, branch-free code, and other deep
topics. A must-have for hardware designers. The website, which has extra
material and errata, has since gone down, so this is an Archive.org link.

<li>Ken Chapman's <a
href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp272.pdf">Get
Smart About Reset: Think Local, Not Global</a> discusses why, on FPGAs, it's
important to minimize the number of registers receiving a reset signal, and to
instead use the built-in register initialization at configuration or to
architect the system to eventually get to a consistent state after a minimal
reset.

<h2>Elastic Pipelines</h2>

<p>The following papers are mainly useful for background and for implementation
guides to pipeline branches, joins, forks, etc... Note however that in the
academic literature, elastic pipelines are often expressed as valid/stop
handshakes, rather than valid/ready handshakes, where "stop" is the inverse of
"ready".  This means parts of the diagrams have inverted logic from what it
would be in valid/ready handshakes. Also, watch out for combinational paths,
which aren't completely avoided in these designs: use <a
href="./Pipeline_Skid_Buffer.html">Skid Buffers</a> as necessary.
