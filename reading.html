<h1>References and Reading List</h1>

<p>Here are the sources I've used while writing the FPGA Design Elements,
covering digital design, bit manipulation, elastic pipelines, and clock-domain
crossing.

<h2>Digital Design</h2>

<ul>

<li>Ken Chapman's <a
href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp272.pdf">Get
Smart About Reset: Think Local, Not Global</a> discusses why, on FPGAs, it's
important to minimize the number of registers receiving a reset signal, and to
instead use the built-in register initialization at configuration or to
architect the system to eventually get to a consistent state after a minimal
reset.

</ul>

<a name="bit"</a> 
<h2>Bit Manipulation</h2>

<p>Bit manipulation algorithms usually contain only Boolean, bit-shift, and
addition operations, are often branch-free, and operate in parallel on all the
bits in a word. Thus, they translate naturally to high-performance hardware.
Note that many bit manipulation algorithms assume a certain word width, which
affects the necessary constants.

<li> <a name="Warren2013"></a><a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916060535/http://hackersdelight.org/">Hacker's
Delight</a>, 2nd ed., 2013, Henry S. Warren, Jr. This book covers algorithms
related to bit manipulation, arithmetic, branch-free code, and other deep
topics. A must-have for hardware designers. The website, which has extra
material and errata, has since gone down, so this is an Archive.org link.

<li> <a href="https://catonmat.net/low-level-bit-hacks">Introduction to Low
Level Bit Hacks</a> provides a detailed explanation of the fundamental bit
manipulations from which most others are built. (See: Hacker's Delight, Chapter
2, "Basics").

<li> <a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html">Bit
Twiddling Hacks</a> is another repository of bit manipulation algorithms,
complementing Hacker's Delight.

<li> <a href="http://aggregate.org/MAGIC/">The Aggregate Magic Algorithms</a>
has a few different algorithms, and notably, SWAR (SIMD Within A Register).

<li> <a href=""https://bits.stephan-brumme.com>the bit twiddler</a> lists some
C code, with cycle counts, explanations, and assembly output.

<li> <a href="http://programming.sirrida.de/">Programming pages</a> of Jasper
Neumann. Detailed explanations with beautiful diagrams.

<li> <a href=""https://github.com/keon/awesome-bits>awesome-bits</a> by Keon
Kim. Some nifty string and float algorithms here.

used to represent chess boards, which lend themselves to a rich discussion of
various bit algorithms and their implementations:

<a name="elastic"</a> 
<h2>Elastic Pipelines</h2>

<p>The following papers are mainly useful for background and for implementation
guides to pipeline branches, joins, forks, etc... Note however that in the
academic literature, elastic pipelines are often expressed as valid/stop
handshakes, rather than valid/ready handshakes, where "stop" is the inverse of
"ready".  This means parts of the diagrams have inverted logic from what it
would be in valid/ready handshakes. Also, watch out for combinational paths,
which aren't completely avoided in these designs: use <a
href="./Pipeline_Skid_Buffer.html">Skid Buffers</a> as necessary.

<h2>Clock Domain Crossing</h2>

<p>Frankly, most writing about CDC is superficial and subtly wrong. Here is some of the best writings on the topic.
