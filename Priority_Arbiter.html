<h1>A Priority Arbiter.</h1>
<p>Returns a one-hot bitmask of the least-significant bit set in a word, where
 bit 0 can be viewed as having highest priority. 
 There's no logic added here, but we wrap <a href="./Bitmask_Isolate_Rightmost_1_Bit.html">the relevant bitmask
 module</a> to show the intended usage.</p>
<p>A common use-case for an arbiter is to drive a <a href="./Multiplexer_One_Hot.html">one-hot
 multiplexer</a> to select one of multiple senders
 requesting for one receiver, or one of multiple receivers requesting from
 one sender. This arrangement requires that the requestors can raise and
 hold a "request" signal, wait until they receive the "grant" signal to
 begin their transaction, and to drop "request" only once they are done.
 This is very similar to a ready/valid handshake, except that the
 transaction cannot be interrupted, else the granted access is lost.</p>
<p>Note that if a higher-priority request happens too frequently, even if
 brief, it will starve lower priority requests. To reduce this effect, you
 need a <a href="./Round_Robin_Arbiter.html">Round-Robin Arbiter</a>, which is built-up
 from two Priority Arbiters.</p>
