<h1>A Synchronous Register to Store and Control Data</h1>
<p>It may seem silly to implement a register module rather than let the HDL
infer it, but doing so separates data and control at the most basic level,
including various kinds of resets, which are part of control. This
separation of data and control allows us to simplify the control logic and
reduce the need for some routing resources.</p>
<h2>Power-on-Reset</h2>
<p>On FPGAs, the initial state of registers is set in the configuration
bitstream and applied by special power-on reset circuitry. The initial
state of a design is available "for free" <em>and can be returned to at
run-time</em>, which removes the need for that control and data logic.</p>
<h2>Asynchronous Reset</h2>
<p>On FPGAs, the hardware reset of a flip-flop is usually asynchronous and so
takes effect immediately rather than at the next clock edge, which can
cause subtle bugs: a register appears to fail to capture data in
behavioural simulation, or changes in impossible ways (within less than
a clock cycle) in timing-annotated post-synthesis simulation.  Where
possible, avoid the use of the asynchronous reset and instead depend on the
power-on-reset to initially load the reset value. This reduces the size of
the reset network and simplifies place-and-route.</p>
<p>The asynchronous reset is necessary to force a register reset where the
control logic to the register(s) might be stuck. It is necessary to feed the
reset from a clock-sychronous source so registers don't flip value close to
the metastability window of a downstream register.</p>
<h2>Synchronous Reset (a.k.a. Clear)</h2>
<p>If you need to clear the register during normal operation, use the
synchronous clear input. This may create extra logic, but that logic gets
folded into other logic feeding data to the register, and would have been
necessary anyway but present as another case in the surrounding logic.
Having a clear input allows us to get to the initial power-on-reset state
without complicating the design.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Let's begin with the usual front matter:</p>

<pre>
`default_nettype none

module Register
#(
    parameter WORD_WIDTH  = 0,
    parameter RESET_VALUE = 0
)
(
    input   wire                        clock,
    input   wire                        clock_enable,
    input   wire                        areset,
    input   wire                        clear,
    input   wire    [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    data_in,
    output  reg     [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    data_out
);

    initial begin
        data_out = RESET_VALUE;
    end
</pre>

<p>Normally, I would use the "last assignment wins" idiom (See
<a href="./verilog.html#resets">Resets</a> in the <a href="./verilog.html">Verilog Coding
Standard</a>) to implement reset, but that doesn't work
here: having two separate if-statements (one for clock_enable followed
by one for reset) does not work when the reset is asynchronously
specified in the sensitivity list (as done here), as there is no way to
determine which signal in the sensitivity list each if statement should
respond to.</p>
<p>Thus, correct hardware inference depends on explicitly expressing the
priority of the reset over the clock_enable structurally with nested
if-statements, rather than implicitly through the Verilog event queue
via the "last assignment wins" idiom.</p>
<p>This is very likely the <em>only</em> place you will ever need an asynchronous
signal in a sensitivity list, or express explicit structural priority.</p>

<pre>
    reg [WORD_WIDTH-1:0] selected = RESET_VALUE;

    always @(*) begin
        selected = (clear == 1'b1) ? RESET_VALUE : data_in;
    end

    always @(posedge clock or posedge areset) begin
        if (areset == 1'b1) begin
            data_out <= RESET_VALUE;
        end
        else begin
            if ((clock_enable == 1'b1) || (clear == 1'b1)) begin
                data_out <= selected;
            end
        end
    end

endmodule
