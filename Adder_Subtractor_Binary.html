<h1>A Simple Binary Integer Adder/Subtractor</h1>
<p>This is a basic signed integer adder/subtractor, with carry-in and carry-out.
 The operation is selected with <code>add_sub</code>: setting it to 0 for an ad (A+B), and
 to 1 for a subtract (A-B). This assignment matches the convention of sign bits,
 which may end up being convenient.</p>
<p>On FPGAs, you are much better off letting the CAD tool infer the
 add/subtract circuitry from the <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> operator itself, rather than
 structurally describing it in logic, as the latter may not get mapped to
 the fast, dedicated ripple-carry hardware. Wrapping all this into a module
 hides the width adjustment necessary to get a warning-free synthesis of
 carry logic.</p>
<p>Because we handle the carry bit ourselves, we don't depend on the tricky
 Verilog behaviour where all terms of an expression must be declared signed
 else the expression is silently evaluated as unsigned!</p>

module <a href="./Adder_Subtractor_Binary.html">Adder_Subtractor_Binary</a>
#(
    parameter       WORD_WIDTH          = 0
)
(
    input   wire                        add_sub,    // 0/1 -> A+B/A-B
    input   wire                        carry_in,
    input   wire    [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    A_in,
    input   wire    [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    B_in,
    output  reg     [WORD_WIDTH-1:0]    sum_out,
    output  reg                         carry_out
);

    localparam ZERO = {WORD_WIDTH{1'b0}};

    initial begin
        sum_out     = ZERO;
        carry_out   = 1'b0;
    end
</pre>

<p>Extend the <code>carry_in</code> to the <em>unsigned</em> extended word width, so we don't
 have width mismatches nor rely on sign extension, which is full of
 pitfalls, and would trigger useless warnings in the CAD tools.</p>

<pre>
    wire [WORD_WIDTH-1:0] carry_in_extended;

    <a href="./Width_Adjuster.html">Width_Adjuster</a>
    #(
        .WORD_WIDTH_IN  (1),
        .SIGNED         (0),
        .WORD_WIDTH_OUT (WORD_WIDTH)  // Must be greater or equal to WORD_WIDTH_IN
    )
    extend_carry_in
    (
        .original_input     (carry_in),
        .adjusted_output    (carry_in_extended)
    );
</pre>

<p>Then perform and select the operation in the usual way. On FPGAs, the CAD
 tool will feed <code>carry_in</code> to the carry-in pin of the dedicated adder
 circuitry.</p>

<pre>
    always @(*) begin
        {carry_out, sum_out} = (add_sub == 1'b0) ? A_in + B_in + carry_in_extended : A_in - B_in - carry_in_extended;
    end

endmodule
