<h1>Appendix: Open Questions</h1>

<p>For example, implementing a universal multiplexer module (any number of
inputs of a given width, using a binary selector) is straightforward using a
Verilog vector part select. Implementing it using Design modules first suggests
using NOT-AND logic to select an input, which would require complex conditional
generation of NOT gates in a Verilog generate block.

<p>However, viewing the problem as one of address decoding, then one can use a
much simpler generate loop to iterate over the range of selector values and
instantiate a single address decoder module (which already exists) for each
case, without any conditional logic. This approach also generalizes the
original vector part select design since we could use arbitrary,
non-consecutive sets of selector values by passing them as a concatenation in a
parameter.

<p>Given the limits of Verilog parsing and synthesis tools, I expect the limits
of the Design subset to lie downwards, in low-level implementation details
which affect synthesis and portability.

<p>For example, I have found in the past that implementing addition directly as
XOR-AND Boolean logic yields unexpectedly poor synthesis results on FPGAs,
worse than simply inferring from a "+" operator. This is a loss, as it removes
the possibility of the beginner to open up an adder and see its implementation.

<p>Similarly, I am currently investigating the inference of synchronous resets
for FPGA flip-flops: using an AND gate to zero the output results in separate
logic, while using a multiplexer to select a zero output results in using the
built-in synchronous reset of the flip-flop. This appears to be simple pattern
matching by the synthesis tool. Either approach is desirable depending on the
design, and can be encapsulated and made explicit by the Design subset module
library.
