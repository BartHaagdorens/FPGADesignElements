<h1>Useful Books</h1>

<p>No book can cover everything about digital design, and many topics I have
learnt and understood from others. But here are the books I refer to in this
text, or which I think would be particularly useful to others.

<ul>

<li> <a name="Warren2013"></a><a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190916060535/http://hackersdelight.org/">Hacker's
Delight</a>, 2nd ed., 2013, Henry S. Warren, Jr. This book covers algorithms
related to bit manipulation, arithmetic, branch-free code, and other deep
topics. A must-have for hardware designers. The website, which has extra
material and errata, has since gone down, so this is an Archive.org link.
