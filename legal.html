<p>Hopefully, this license should be straightforward to get past your manager or legal team.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>It's simply not possible for a single person to write and test and
exhaustively verify all the code in this book, and still get anything done.
Thus, the state of the code and guidelines in this book ranges from "it should
work, in theory" to "actively used in commercial applications".  That said, the
provided design elements are each rather small and easy to manually inspect.
Each module is run through the Verilator linter to find mistakes, and then
through the Intel Quartus Prime CAD tool to find any elaboration and synthesis
issues. <em><b>Use at your own risk.</b></em></p>

<p>If you do find any bugs, please accept my apologies, and 
<a href="mailto:eric@fpgacpu.ca?subject=FPGA%20Design%20Elements">do let me know</a> so I can fix them. (Or better
yet, please share your fix so I can include it here.) </p>
